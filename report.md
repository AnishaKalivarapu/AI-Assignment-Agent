AI Assignment Assistant Agent – Project Report
1. Introduction

Objective: Automate the task of drafting university assignments using AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing multi-step workflows.

Scope:

Use of fine-tuned LLM (LoRA) for academic content generation.

Modular agent architecture: Planner → Writer → Reviewer.

Evaluation of output quality with multi-metric review.

2. Task Selection

Manual Task: Drafting university assignments from a given topic prompt.

Reason for Selection:

Highly repetitive task that benefits from structured reasoning.

Requires integration of planning, content generation, and review.

Easily measurable outputs via metrics and automated evaluation.

3. Agent Architecture

Components:

Planner Agent: Generates a structured outline from a topic.

Writer Agent: Generates draft content using a fine-tuned LLM (LoRA).

Reviewer Agent: Evaluates draft quality based on coherence, relevance, style, and grammar.

Interaction Flow:
User -> Planner Agent -> Writer Agent -> Reviewer Agent -> User
Refer to architecture.md for full diagrams and detailed maps.


4. Fine-Tuning Setup

Model: Base LLM (e.g., LLaMA, GPT-style) fine-tuned using LoRA.

Dataset:

Collection of academic assignments and reports from public sources.

Split: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing.

Preprocessing: Cleaning, section labeling, tokenization.

Method:

LoRA applied to base LLM to specialize on academic writing style.

Training hyperparameters:

Learning rate: 2e-4

Epochs: 3–5

Batch size: 16

Training was performed on GPU for efficient parameter tuning.

Outcome:

Model now reliably generates structured academic text.

Reduced hallucinations and improved coherence across sections.

5. Evaluation Methodology

Metrics:

Coherence: Checks if sections are logically structured.

Relevance: Measures if content aligns with the topic and outline.

Style: Academic tone, clarity, and readability.

Grammar: Correct language usage and formatting.

Evaluation Process:

Reviewer Agent applies these metrics to each draft.

Quantitative evaluation: Pass/Fail for each metric.

Qualitative evaluation: Human review for alignment with expectations.

Example:

Metric	Score
Coherence	Pass
Relevance	Pass
Style	Good
Grammar	Good
